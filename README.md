We developed a distributed service-oriented application that allows users to order all necessary ingredients for recipes from multiple external suppliers located around the world. The system functions as a broker that coordinates composite orders by checking real-time stock availability from independent supplier services. This ensures users can order complete ingredient sets with a single action, while the broker handles all back-end communication and transactional integrity across the distributed services.
